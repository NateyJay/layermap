Description: A simple library meant to help users make publication quality
    heatmaps, with a syntax suited to modular annotations on the sides
    (layers). This allows the user to define a custom image, with custom
    grouping, clustering, ordering, coloring, and labels, all of which are
    easily readable with vector-graphics software.
