### To do:
# [x] allow optional inclusion of a hclust or tree to use instead of standard clustering
# [?] override NA clustering problems by giving an NA.value option
# [ ] column/row select for clustering
# [ ] plotting points inside of boxes (varying size, color, type)
# [x] allow col.df in invocation
# [x] more sensible sizing defaults for color legend (to short, thin)
# [x] auto-require essential tools (stringr, dendextend)
# [ ] cutree and kmeans implementation
# [x] error if you try to make a dend for unclustered axes
